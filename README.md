# AWS_MMS
Adaptation of AWS MMS for local test


This is a simple yet efficient way to use the AWS Multi-Model-Server script for local tests!

It's for you if it's not time yet to move to the cloud and pay for hosting your models on third parties buckets or just because you're still in an early stage of your project,
where local environments can work perfect to make first tries!!
